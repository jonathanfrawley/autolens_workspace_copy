    To begin, we define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This is the lens model that is f

    We now define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This is the lens model that is fitted to 
    every simulated strong lens without a subhalo, giving us the Bayesian evidence which we compare to the model which 
    includes one!). 

    For this model, we can use the result of fitting this model to the dataset before sensitivity mapping via the 
    mass pipeline. This ensures the priors associated with each parameter are initialized so as to speed up
    each non-linear search performed during sensitivity mapping.
    """
    base_model = mass_results.last.model

    """
    We now define the `perturbation_model`, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform 
    sensitivity mapping. In this case, this model is a `SphNFWMCRLudlow` model and we will iterate over its
    `centre` and `mass_at_200`. We set it up as a `Model` so it has an associated redshift and can be directly
    passed to the tracer in the simulate function below.

    Many instances of the `perturbation_model` are created and used to simulate the many strong lens datasets that we fit. 
    However, it is only included in half of the model-fits; corresponding to the lens models which include a dark matter 
    subhalo and whose Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the `base_model` to 
    determine if the subhalo was detectable.

    By fitting both models to every simulated lens, we therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every model to every 
    dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of `centre` and `mass_at_200` in the dark mattter 
    subhalo the model-fit including a subhalo provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit (and
    therefore when it is detectable!).

    Parameters

    path_prefix
        The prefix of folders between the output path and the search folders.
    uv_wavelengths
        The wavelengths of the interferometer baselines used for mapping to Fourier space.
    real_space_mask
        The mask in real space which defines how lensed images are computed.
    mass_results
        The results of the SLaM MASS PIPELINE which ran before this pipeline.
    analysis_cls
        The analysis class which includes the `log_likelihood_function` and can be customized for the SLaM model-fit. A
        new instance of this class is created for every model-fit.
    subhalo_mass
        The `MassProfile` used to fit the subhalo in this pipeline.
    grid_dimension_arcsec
        the arc-second dimensions of the grid in the y and x directions. An input value of 3.0" means the grid in
        all four directions extends to 3.0" giving it dimensions 6.0" x 6.0".
    number_of_steps
        The 2D dimensions of the grid (e.g. number_of_steps x number_of_steps) that the subhalo search is performed for.
    number_of_cores
        The number of cores used to perform the non-linear search grid search. If 1, each model-fit on the grid is
        performed in serial, if > 1 fits are distributed in parallel using the Python multiprocessing module.
    unique_tag
        The unique tag for this model-fit, which will be given a unique entry in the sqlite database and also acts as
        the folder after the path prefix and before the search name. This is typically the name of the dataset.

    To begin, we define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This is the lens model that is f
    itted to every simulated strong lens without a subhalo, giving us the Bayesian evidence which we compare to the model
    which includes one!).

    """
    We now define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This is the lens model that is fitted to 
    every simulated strong lens without a subhalo, giving us the Bayesian evidence which we compare to the model which 
    includes one!). 

    For this model, we can use the result of fitting this model to the dataset before sensitivity mapping via the 
    mass pipeline. This ensures the priors associated with each parameter are initialized so as to speed up
    each non-linear search performed during sensitivity mapping.
    """
    base_model = mass_results.last.model

    """
    We now define the `perturbation_model`, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform 
    sensitivity mapping. In this case, this model is a `SphNFWMCRLudlow` model and we will iterate over its
    `centre` and `mass_at_200`. We set it up as a `Model` so it has an associated redshift and can be directly
    passed to the tracer in the simulate function below.

    Many instances of the `perturbation_model` are created and used to simulate the many strong lens datasets that we fit. 
    However, it is only included in half of the model-fits; corresponding to the lens models which include a dark matter 
    subhalo and whose Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the `base_model` to 
    determine if the subhalo was detectable.

    By fitting both models to every simulated lens, we therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every model to every 
    dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of `centre` and `mass_at_200` in the dark mattter 
    subhalo the model-fit including a subhalo provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit (and
    therefore when it is detectable!).
