    The SlaM LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE for fitting imaging data with a lens light component.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_prefix
        The prefix of folders between the output path and the search folders.
    analysis
        The analysis class which includes the `log_likelihood_function` and can be customized for the SLaM model-fit.
    setup_hyper
        The setup of the hyper analysis if used (e.g. hyper-galaxy noise scaling).
    source_results
        The results of the SLaM SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE or SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE which ran before this pipeline.
    lens_bulge
        The `LightProfile` `Model` used to represent the light distribution of the lens galaxy's bulge (set to
        None to omit a bulge).
    lens_disk
        The `LightProfile` `Model` used to represent the light distribution of the lens galaxy's disk (set to
        None to omit a disk).
    lens_envelope
        The `LightProfile` `Model` used to represent the light distribution of the lens galaxy's envelope (set to
        None to omit an envelope).
    end_with_hyper_extension
        If `True` a hyper extension is performed at the end of the pipeline. If this feature is used, you must be
        certain you have manually passed the new hyper images geneted in this search to the next pipelines.
    unique_tag
        The unique tag for this model-fit, which will be given a unique entry in the sqlite database and also acts as
        the folder after the path prefix and before the search name. This is typically the name of the dataset.
    """

    """
    __Model + Search + Analysis + Model-Fit (Search 1)__

    In search 1 of the LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE we fit a lens model where:

     - The lens galaxy light is modeled using parametric bulge + disk + envelope [no prior initialization].
     - The lens galaxy mass is modeled using SOURCE PIPELINE's mass distribution [Parameters fixed from MASS PIPELINE].
     - The source galaxy's light is modeled using SOURCE PIPELINE's model [Parameters fixed from SOURCE PIPELINE].

    This search aims to produce an accurate model of the lens galaxy's light, which may not have been possible in the
    SOURCE PIPELINE as the mass and source models were not properly initialized.
    """

    """
    If hyper-galaxy noise scaling for the lens is on, it may have scaled the noise to high values in the SOURCE
    PIPELINE (which fitted a simpler lens light model than this pipeline). The new lens light model fitted in this
    pipeline may fit the data better, requiring a reducing level of noise scaling. For this reason, the noise scaling
    normalization is included as a free parameter.
