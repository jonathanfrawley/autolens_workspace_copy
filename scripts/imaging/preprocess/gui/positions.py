"""
GUI Preprocessing: Positions
============================

This tool allows one to input the positions of strong lenses via a GUI, which can be used to resample inaccurate
mass models during lensing modeling.

Setup the path the datasets we'll use to illustrate preprocessing, which is the

"""
When you click on a pixel to mark a position, the search box looks around this click and finds the pixel with
the highest flux to mark the position.

The `search_box_size` is the number of pixels around your click this search takes place.

For lenses with bright lens light emission, it can be difficult to get the source light to show. The normalization
below uses a log-scale with a capped maximum, which better contrasts the lens and source emission.
