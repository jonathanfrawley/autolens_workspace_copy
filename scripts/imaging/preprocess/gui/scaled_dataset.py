"""
GUI Preprocessing: Scaled Dataset
=================================

This tool allows one to mask a bespoke noise-map for a given image of a strong lens, using a GUI.

This noise-map is primarily used for increasing the variances of pixels that have non-modeled components in an image,
for example intervening line-of-sight galaxies that are near the lens, but not directly interfering with the
analysis of the lens and source galaxies.

First, load the `Imaging` dataset, so that the location of galaxies is clear when scaling the noise-map.
