"""
GUI Preprocessing: Mask
=======================

This tool allows one to mask a bespoke mask for a given image of a strong lens using an interactive GUI. This mask
can then be loaded before a pipeline is run and passed to that pipeline so as to become the default masked used by a
search (if a mask function is not passed to that search).

# from pyprojroot import here
# workspace_path = str(here())
# %cd $workspace_path
# print(f"Working Directory has been set to `{workspace_path}`")

"""
Setup the path the datasets we'll use to illustrate preprocessing, which is the 
folder `dataset/imaging/with_lens_light/mass_sie__source_sersic`.
"""
dataset_name = "mass_sie__source_sersic"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "imaging", "no_lens_light", dataset_name)

"""
If you use this tool for your own dataset, you *must* double check this pixel scale is correct!
"""
pixel_scales = 0.1

"""
First, load the `Imaging` dataset, so that the mask can be plotted over the strong lens image.
"""
image = al.Array2D.from_fits(
    file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "image.fits"), pixel_scales=pixel_scales
)

"""
Load the GUI for drawing the mask. Push Esc when you are finished drawing the mask.
"""
scribbler = scribbler.Scribbler(image=image.native)
mask = scribbler.show_mask()
mask = al.Mask2D.manual(mask=np.invert(mask), pixel_scales=pixel_scales)

"""
Now lets plot the image and mask, so we can check that the mask includes the regions of the image we want.
"""
visuals_2d = aplt.Visuals2D(mask=mask)
array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=image, visuals_2d=visuals_2d)
array_2d_plotter.figure()

"""
Now we`re happy with the mask, lets output it to the dataset folder of the lens, so that we can load it from a .fits
file in our pipelines!
"""
mask.output_to_fits(file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "mask.fits"), overwrite=True)
