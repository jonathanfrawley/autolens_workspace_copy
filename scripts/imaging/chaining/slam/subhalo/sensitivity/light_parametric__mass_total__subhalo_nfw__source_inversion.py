SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Light Parametric + Mass Total + Subhalo NFW + Source Parametric
==============================================================================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling a specific aspect of the strong
lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these pipelines has it own inputs which
which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `EllSersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE, LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE, MASS TOTAL PIPELINE and SUBHALO PIPELINE this SLaM script
fits `Imaging` of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge+disk `EllSersic` and `EllExponential`.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllIsothermal`.
 - A dark matter subhalo near The lens galaxy mass is included as a`SphNFWMCRLudLow`.
 - The source galaxy is an `Inversion`.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_parametric/with_lens_light`
 `source__inversion/with_lens_light`
 `light_parametric/with_lens_light`
 `mass_total/with_lens_light`
 `subhalo/detection_single_plane`

"""
__SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE (with lens light) uses three searches to initialize a robust model for the 
source galaxy's light, which in this example:
 
 - Uses a parametric `EllSersic` bulge and `EllExponential` disk with centres aligned for the lens
 galaxy's light.
 
 - Uses an `EllIsothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.

 __Settings__:

 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the MASS TOTAL PIPELINE).

"""
__SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE (with lens light) uses four searches to initialize a robust model for the `Inversion` 
that reconstructs the source galaxy's light. It begins by fitting a `VoronoiMagnification` pixelization with `Constant` 
regularization, to set up the model and hyper images, and then:

 - Uses a `VoronoiBrightnessImage` pixelization.
 - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE through to the
 SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE.

__Settings__:

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_inversion.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.

"""
__LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE__

The LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE uses one search to fit a complex lens light model to a high level of accuracy, using the
lens mass model and source light model fixed to the maximum log likelihood result of the SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE.
In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `EllSersic` bulge and `EllSersic` disk with centres aligned for the lens galaxy's 
 light [Do not use the results of the SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE to initialize priors].

 - Uses an `EllIsothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution [fixed from SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE].

 - Uses an `Inversion` for the source's light [priors fixed from SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE].

 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE [fixed values].
 
__Preloads__: 
 
 - Inversion: We preload linear algebra matrices used by the inversion using the maximum likelihood hyper-result of the 
 SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE. This ensures these matrices are not recalculated every iteration of the log likelihood 
 function, speeding up the model-fit (this is possible because the mass model and source pixelization are fixed).

)

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light) uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIPELINE to initialize the model priors and the lens light
model of the LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE. In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `EllSersic` bulge and `EllSersic` disk with centres aligned for the lens galaxy's 
 light [fixed from LIGHT PARAMETRIC PIPELINE].

 - Uses an `EllPowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE + centre unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 
 - Uses the `EllSersic` model representing a bulge for the source's light [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE].
 
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS TOTAL
 PIPELINE.
 
__Preloads__:
 
 - Pixelization: We preload the pixelization using the maximum likelihood hyper-result of the SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE. 
 This ensures the source pixel-grid is not recalculated every iteration of the log likelihood function, speeding up 
 the model-fit (this is only possible because the source pixelization is fixed).

"""
__SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping)__

The SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping) performs sensitivity mapping of the data using the lens model
fitted above, so as to determine where subhalos of what mass could be detected in the data. A full description of
sensitivty mapping if given in the script `sensitivity_mapping.py`.

Each model-fit performed by sensitivity mapping creates a new instance of an `Analysis` class, which contains the
data simulated by the `simulate_function` for that model. This requires us to write a wrapper around the 
PyAutoLens `AnalysisImaging` class.

__Preloads__:
 
 - Pixelization: We preload the pixelization using the maximum likelihood hyper-result of the SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE. 
 This ensures the source pixel-grid is not recalculated every iteration of the log likelihood function, speeding up 
 the model-fit (this is only possible because the source pixelization is fixed).
