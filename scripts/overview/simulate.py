Overview: Simulate
------------------

**PyAutoLens** provides tool for simulating strong lens data-sets, which can be used to test lens modeling pipelines
and train neural networks to recognise and analyse images of strong lenses.

In this overview `autolens_workspace/scripts/overview/lensing.py` we used a  tracer and grid to create an image of
 a strong lens.

"""
Simulating strong lens images uses a `SimulatorImaging` object, which models the process that an instrument like the
Hubble Space Telescope goes through observe a strong lens. This includes accounting for the exposure time to 
determine the signal-to-noise of the data, blurring the observed light of the strong lens with the telescope optics 
and accounting for the background sky in the exposure which adds Poisson noise.
"""
psf = al.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=0.05)

simulator = al.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, background_sky_level=1.0, psf=psf, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
Once we have a simulator, we can use it to create an imaging dataset which consists of an image, noise-map and 
Point Spread Function (PSF) by passing it a tracer and grid.

This uses the tracer above to create the image of the strong lens and then add the effects that occur during data
acquisition.
"""
imaging = simulator.from_tracer_and_grid(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)

"""
By plotting a subplot of the `Imaging` dataset, we can see this object includes the observed image of the strong lens
(which has had noise and other instrumental effects added to it) as well as a noise-map and PSF:
"""
imaging_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(imaging=imaging)
imaging_plotter.subplot_imaging()

"""
The `autolens_workspace` includes many example simulators for simulating strong lenses with a range of different 
physical properties, to make imaging datasets for a variety of telescopes (e.g. Hubble, Euclid) as well as 
interferometer datasets.
