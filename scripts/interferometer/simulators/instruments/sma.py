Simulator: SMA
==============

This script simulates `Interferometer` data of a strong lens where:

 - The resolution, UV wavelengths and S/N are representative of Square Mile Array (SMA) interferometry.

__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name` 
gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_label/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_label/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autolens_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_label/dataset_name/psf.fits`.
"""
dataset_type = "instruments"
dataset_instrument = "sma"

"""
The path where the dataset will be output, which in this case is
`/autolens_workspace/dataset/interferometer/instruments/sma/mass_sie__source_sersic`
"""
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "interferometer", dataset_type, dataset_instrument)

"""
__Simulate__

For simulating an image of a strong lens, we recommend using a Grid2DIterate object. This represents a grid of (y,x) 
coordinates like an ordinary Grid2D, but when the light-profile`s image is evaluated below (using the Tracer) the 
sub-size of the grid is iteratively increased (in steps of 2, 4, 8, 16, 24) until the input fractional accuracy of 
99.99% is met.

This ensures that the divergent and bright central regions of the source galaxy are fully resolved when determining the
total flux emitted within a pixel.
"""
grid = al.Grid2DIterate.uniform(
    shape_native=(251, 251), pixel_scales=0.05, fractional_accuracy=0.9999
)

"""
To perform the Fourier transform we need the wavelengths of the baselines, which we'll load from the fits file below.

By default we use baselines from the Square Mile Array (SMA), which produces low resolution interferometer data that
can be fitted extremely efficiently. The `autolens_workspace` includes ALMA uv_wavelengths files for simulating
much high resolution datasets (which can be performed by replacing "sma.fits" below with "alma.fits").
"""
uv_wavelengths_path = path.join("dataset", "interferometer", "uv_wavelengths")
uv_wavelengths = al.util.array_1d.numpy_array_1d_from_fits(
    file_path=path.join(uv_wavelengths_path, "sma.fits"), hdu=0
)

"""
To simulate the interferometer dataset we first create a simulator, which defines the shape, resolution and pixel-scale 
of the visibilities that are simulated, as well as its exposure time, noise levels and uv-wavelengths.

__Ray Tracing__

Setup the lens galaxy's mass (SIE+Shear) and source galaxy light (elliptical Sersic) for this simulated lens.

"""
Use these galaxies to setup a tracer, which will generate the image for the simulated `Imaging` dataset.

"""
We can now pass this simulator a tracer, which creates the ray-traced image plotted above and simulates it as an
interferometer dataset.

Lets plot the simulated interferometer dataset before we output it to fits.

Pickle the `Tracer` in the dataset folder, ensuring the true `Tracer` is safely stored and available if we need to 
check how the dataset was simulated in the future.
