Chaining: Chaining Parametric To Inversion
==========================================

Before reading this example, make sure you have read the `autolens_workspace/notebooks/interferometer/modeling/chaining/api.py`
example script, which describes phase chaining and details the API for this.

In this example, we chain two phases, where:

- Both phases model the lens galaxy's mass as an `EllipticalIsothermal`, with the lens's light omitted.
    
- The first phase models the source galaxy using a parametric `EllipticalSersic` profile.
    
- The second phase models the source galaxy using an `Inversion`, where its `EllipticalIsothermal` mass model
priors are initialized using the results of phase 1.

There are a number of benefits to chaining a parametric source model to an _Inversion, as opposed to fitting the
`Inversion` in one phase:

- Parametric sources are computationally faster to evaluate and fit to the data than an `Inversion`. Thus, although
the `EllipticalSersic` carries with it more parameters that the `NonLinearSearch` will have to fit for, the
model-fit will be faster overall given the increased speed of each log likelihood evaluation.

- `Inversion`'s often go to unphysical solutions where the mass model goes to extremely high / low normalizations
and the source is reconstructed as a demagnified version of the lensed source (see Chapter 4, tutorial 6 for a
complete description of this effect). A powerful way to prevent this from happening is to initialize the mass
model with a fit using a parametric source (which does not suffer these unphysical solutions) and use this result
to ensure the `NonLinearSearch` samples only the maximal likelihood regions of parameter space.
      
- To further remove these solutions, we use the `auto_positions` feature of the `SettingsPhaseInterferometer`, which use
the maximum log likelihood mass model of the first phase to determine the positions in the image-plane the
brightest regions of the lensed source trace too. In phase 2, mass models must trace these positions into a
threshold arc-secoond value of one another in the source-plane, ensuring the incorrect solutions corresponding to
unphysically large / small mass models are removed.

As per usual, load the `Interferometer` data, create the real space mask. In this strong lensing dataset:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllipticalIsothermal`.
 - The source galaxy's `LightProfile` is an `EllipticalExponential`.

__Model__

We compose our lens model using `GalaxyModel` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data. In this 
example our lens mooel is:

 - An `EllipticalIsothermal` `MassProfile`.for the lens galaxy's mass (5 parameters).
 - An `EllipticalSersic` `LightProfile`.for the source galaxy's light (6 parameters) in phase 1.
 - An `Inversion` in phase 2 (3 parameters).

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=11.

__Settings__

You should be familiar with the `SettingsPhaseInterferometer` object from other example scripts, if not checkout 
the beginner examples and `autolens_workspace/notebooks/interferometer/modeling/customize/settings.py`

In this example we use the `auto_positions` inputs. These positions correspond to the brightest pixels of the lensed 
source's multiple images. When a phase uses positions, during model-fitting they must trace within a threshold value of 
one another for every mass model sampled by the non-linear search. If they do not, the model is discard and resampled. 
The setting below lead to the following behaviour for each phase:

- In phase 1, because no positions are input into the `Interferometer` dataset, positions are not used and the 
auto_positions settings do nothing.

- In phase 2, because there are auto_positions settings, the maximum log likelihood model of phase 1 is used too 
compute the positions of the lensed source galaxy and the threshold within which they trace to one another. This
threshold is multiplied by the `auto_positions_factor` to ensure it is not too small (and thus does not remove many 
plausible mass models). If, after this multiplication, the threshold is below the `auto_positions_minimum_threshold`, 
it is rounded up to this minimum value.

for by the non-linear search. In other chaining examples, we'll see other ways to pass prior results.

__Wrap Up__

In this example, we passed used prior passing to initialize a lens mass model using a parametric source and pass this
model to a second phase which modeled the source using an `Inversion`. We won in terms of efficiency and ensuring the
`Inversion` did not go to an unphysical solution.

__Pipelines__

The next level of PyAutoLens uses `Pipelines`, which chain together multiple phases to perform very complex lens 
modeling in robust and efficient ways. Pipelines which fit the source as an `Inversion`, for example:

 `autolens_wokspace/pipelines/no_lens_light/mass_total__source_inversion.py`

Exploit our ability to first model the source using a parametric profile and then switch to an `Inversion`, to ensure 
more efficient and robust model-fits!
