Chaining: Parametric To Inversion
=================================

In this script, we chain two searches to fit `Interferometer` with a strong lens model where:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllipticalIsothermal` and `ExternalShear`.
 - The source galaxy's `LightProfile` is an `EllipticalExponential`.

The two searches break down as follows:

 1) Model the source galaxy using a parametric `EllipticalSersic` and lens galaxy mass as an `EllipticalIsothermal`.
 2) Models the source galaxy using an `Inversion` and lens galaxy mass as an `EllipticalIsothermal`.

__Why Chain?__

There are a number of benefits of chaining a parametric source model and `Inversion`, as opposed to fitting the
`Inversion` in one search:

 - Parametric sources are computationally faster to fit. Therefore, even though the `EllipticalSersic` has more
 parameters for the search to fit than an `Inversion`, the model-fit is faster overall.

 - `Inversion`'s often go to unphysical solutions where the mass model goes to high / low normalizations and the source
 is reconstructed as a demagnified version of the image. (see Chapter 4, tutorial 6 for a complete description of
 this effect). This does not occur for a parametric source, therefore the mass model can be initialized using a
 parametric source, which sets up the search which fits an `Inversion` so as to not sample these unphysical solutions.

 - The `auto_positions` feature can be used to further ensure these unphysical solutions do not bias the model-fit.
 Auto-positions use the maximum log likelihood mass model of the first search to determine the image-plane position of
 the lensed source. In the second search, we then require that a mass model must trace these positions within a threshold
 arc-secoond value of one another in the source-plane, removing these unphysical solutions.

__Model (Search 2)__

We use the results of search 1 to create the lens model fitted in search 2, where:

 - The source-galaxy's light uses a `VoronoiMagnification` pixelization [2 parameters].
 - This pixelization is regularized using a `Constant` scheme which smooths every source pixel equally [1 parameter]. 

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=10.

The term `model` below passes the source model as model-components that are to be fitted for by the 
non-linear search. We pass the `lens` as a `model`, so that we can use the mass model inferred by search 1. The source
does not use any priors from the result of search 1.

"""
__Analysis + Positions__

In this example we use the `auto_positions` feature, where the positions correspond to the (y,x) locations of the 
lensed source's multiple images. When a model-fit uses positions, it requires them to trace within a threshold value of 
one another for every mass model sampled by the non-linear search. If they do not, the model is discarded and resampled. 

The setting below leads to the following behaviour for searches 1 and 2:

 Search 1) No positions are input into the `AnalysisInterferometer`, therefore positions are not used.

 Search 2) Positions are again not manually input in the `AnalysisInterferometer` object. However, because the result of
 search 1 is, alongside the auto_positions settings, the maximum log likelihood model of search 1 is used to
 compute the positions of the lensed source galaxy as well as the threshold within which they trace to one another. 

This threshold is multiplied by the `auto_positions_factor` to ensure it is not too small (and thus does not remove 
plausible mass models). If, after this multiplication, the threshold is below the `auto_positions_minimum_threshold`, 
it is rounded up to this minimum value.

result_2 = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Wrap Up__

In this example, we passed used prior passing to initialize an `EllipticalIsothermal` + `ExternalShear` lens mass model 
using a parametric source and pass this model to a second search which modeled the source using an `Inversion`. 

This was more computationally efficient than just fitting the `Inversion` by itself and helped to ensure that the 
`Inversion` did not go to an unphysical mass model solution which reconstructs the source as a demagnified version
of the lensed image.

__Pipelines__

Advanced search chaining uses `pipelines` that chain together multiple searches to perform complex lens modeling 
in a robust and efficient way. 

The following example pipelines fits an inversion, using the same approach demonstrated in this script of first fitting 
a parametric source:

 `autolens_workspace/interferometer/chaining/pipelines/no_lens_light/mass_total__source_inversion.py`

 __SLaM (Source, Light and Mass)__
 
An even more advanced approach which uses search chaining are the SLaM pipelines, which break the lens modeling 
processing into a series of fits that first perfect the source model, then the lens light model and finally the lens
mass model. 

The SLaM pipelines begin with a parametric Source pipeline, which then switches to an inversion Source pipeline, 
exploiting the chaining technique demonstrated in this example.
