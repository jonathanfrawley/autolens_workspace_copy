SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Mass Total + Source Inversion
============================================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling a specific aspect of the strong
lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these pipelines has it own inputs which
which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `EllSersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS TOTAL PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE, SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE and a MASS TOTAL PIPELINE this SLaM script fits `Interferometer` 
of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is omitted from the data and model.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `EllPowerLaw`.
 - The source galaxy is an `Inversion`.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_parametric/no_lens_light`
 `source__inversion/source_inversion__no_lens_light`
 `mass_total/no_lens_light`

__Redshifts__

"""
__SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE (no lens light)__

The SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE (no lens light) uses one search to initialize a robust model for the source galaxy's 
light, which in this example:

 - Uses a parametric `EllSersic` bulge for the source's light (omitting a disk / envelope).
 - Uses an `EllIsothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.
 
We use the following optional settings:
 
 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the SOURCE INVERSION 
 PIPELINE).

"""
__SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE (no lens light)__

The SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE (no lens light) uses four searches to initialize a robust model for the `Inversion` that
reconstructs the source galaxy's light. It begins by fitting a `VoronoiMagnification` pixelization with `Constant` 
regularization, to set up the model and hyper images, and then:

 - Uses a `VoronoiBrightnessImage` pixelization.
 - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PARAMETRIC PIPELINE through to the
 SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE.

We use the following optional settings:

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_inversion.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (no lens light)__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (no lens light) uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE to initialize the model priors. In this 
example it:

 - Uses an `EllPowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [The centre if unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 - Uses an `Inversion` for the source's light [priors fixed from SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE].
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINES through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE.
 
We use the following optional settings:

 - Hyper: We may be using hyper features and therefore pass the result of the SOURCE INVERSION PIPELINE to use as the
 hyper dataset if required.

 - Positions: We update the positions and positions threshold using the previous model-fitting result (as described 
 in `chaining/examples/parametric_to_inversion.py`) to remove unphysical solutions from the `Inversion` model-fitting.
