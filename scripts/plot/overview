Matplotlib Wrapper Objects
==========================

The PyAutoLens API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to write
any matplotlib code themselves.

For example, you may have seen we are able to plots objects like an imaging dataset or a tracer using a command like:

import autolens.plot as aplt

aplt.Imaging.noise_map(imaging=imaging)
aplt.Tracer.image(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)


However, this raises the question of how a user uses these plotting tools but customizes their appearance using
standard matplotlib inputs. PyAutoLens does this by passing matplotlib wrapper objects (shortered to `mat_wrap`) to a
`mat_plot_2d` object, which is then passed to the method above.

For example, we can make a figure appear using a figsize of (10, 10) as follows:

figure = aplt.Figure(figsize=(10, 10))   [The name `Figure` indicates this object wraps the matplotlib method `plt.figure`]

mat_plot_2d = aplt.MatPlot2D(figure=figure)  [The `mat_plot_2d` can take many different matplotlib wrapper objects]

aplt.Imaging.noise_map(imaging=imaging, mat_plot_2d=mat_plot_2d) [The noise_map will be plotted on a figure with size (10, 10).


In the `autolens_workspace.plot.mat_wrap` section we provide example Python scripts of every matplotlib Wrapper object,
illustrating how they are used to custimize a figure and making it straight forward for a user to copy and paste them
for their own plots.


Base, Structure and Objects
===========================

The matplotlib example wrapper scripts are grouped into the following three folders:

    - mat_base: These wrappers controls the base matplotlib settings, such as the figure appearance, colormap, colorbar
      and legend.

    - mat_structure: These wrappers plot data structures (e.g. an `Array2D` or a `Grid2D`) using matplotlib methods like
      `plt.imshow`, `plt.plot` and `plt.scatter`.

    - mat_obj: These wrappers customize the appearance of specific data components, for example how critical curves
      and caustics appear on figures.


Config Files
============

In `autolens_workspace.config.visualize` you'll note there are many configuration files corresponding to these
matplotlib wrappers. If a setting is listed in one of these config files, this setting will always be used by
default when that matplotlib method is called.

For example, the `Figure.ini` config file has the following lines:

[figure]
figsize=(7, 7)
aspect=square

[subplot]
figsize=auto
aspect=square

This means that when a figure (e.g. a single image) is plotted it will use `figsize=(7,7)` and `aspect="square` if the
values of these parameters are not manually set by the user via the `mat_plot_2d`. Subplots (e.g. more than one image) will
always use `figsize="auto` by default.

These configuration files can be customized such that the appearance of figures and subplots for a user is optimal for
your computer set up.
