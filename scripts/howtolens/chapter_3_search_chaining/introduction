You are now familiar with **PyAutoLens** and have a clear understanding of lens modeling. In this chapter, we'll
introduce search chaining, a concept we mentioned in the previous chapter. Search chaining allows us to generically link
searches together, so that we can seamlessly navigate the complex non-linear parameter spaces that come when fitting
realistic lens models.

Also, be sure to checkout the on-the-fly output I discussed in the summary of chapter 2 (checkout this summary now
if you skipped it!)

With these pipelines, you'll be able to:

1) Fit a lens mass model and source light model to an image of a strongly lensed source.
2) Additionally fit the lens galaxy's light, if it is present.
3) Write customized pipelines for strong lens systems with multiple lens galaxies or source galaxies.
4) Customize pipelines such that the priors on parameters during the fit are adjusted to provide a more robust or
   efficient fit.
