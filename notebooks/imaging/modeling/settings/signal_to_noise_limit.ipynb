        "\n",
        "The benefits of this are:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Model fitting may be subject to over-fitting the highest signal-to-noise regions of the image instead of\n",
        "      providing a global fit to the entire image. For example, if a lensed source has 4 really bright, compact, high\n",
        "      S/N images which are not fitted perfectly by the model, their high chi-squared contribution will drive the model\n",
        "      fit to place more light in those regions, ignoring the lensed source's lower S/N more extended arcs. Limiting the\n",
        "      S/N of these high S/N regions will reduce over-fitting. The same logic applies for foreground lens light\n",
        "      subtractions which are not perfect andn leave large chi-squared residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "      To learn more about this over-fitting problem, checkout chapter 5 of the `HowToLens` lecture series.\n",

        " - If the model-fit has extremely large chi-squared values due to the high S/N of the dataset. The non-linear\n",
        "      search will take a long time exploring this `extreme` parameter space. In the early phases of a pipeline this\n",
        "      often isn't necessary, therefore a signal-to-noise limit can reduce the time an analysis takes to converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "The downsides of this are:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Reducing the S/N of you data may significantly increase the errors of the lens model that you infer.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The noise-map of your data will no longer reflect the true noisy properties of the data, which could bias the\n",
