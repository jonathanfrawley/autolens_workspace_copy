    "When chaining phases:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " - The earlier phases may use `NonLinearSearch` techniques that only seek to maximize the log likelihood and do not\n",

    "   `NonLinearSearch` which does compute errors, but with settings that make sampling faster or omit accurately\n",

    "\n",
    "    mass.einstein_radius = phase1_result.model.galaxies.lens.mass.einstein_radius\n",
    "\n",
    "By invoking the `model` attribute, the prioris passed following 3 rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) The new parameter, in this case the einstein radius, uses a GaussianPrior. A GaussianPrior is ideal, as the 1D \n",
    "       pdf results we compute at the end of a phase are easily summarized as a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) The mean of the GaussianPrior is the median PDF value of the parameter estimated in phase 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "      This ensures that the initial sampling of the new phase`s non-linear starts by searching the region of non-linear \n",
    "      parameter space that correspond to highest log likelihood solutions in the previous phase. Thus, we`re setting \n",
    "      our priors to look in the `correct` regions of parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) The sigma of the Gaussian will use the maximum of two values: \n",
    "\n",
    "            (i) the 1D error of the parameter computed at an input sigma value (default sigma=3.0).\n",
    "            (ii) The value specified for the profile in the `config/priors/*.json` config file`s `width_modifer` \n",
    "                 field (check these files out now).\n",
    "\n",
    "       The idea here is simple. We want a value of sigma that gives a GaussianPrior wide enough to search a broad \n",
    "       region of parameter space, so that the lens model can change if a better solution is nearby. However, we want it \n",
    "       to be narrow enough that we don't search too much of parameter space, as this will be slow or risk leading us \n",
    "       into an incorrect solution! A natural choice is the errors of the parameter from the previous phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Unfortunately, this doesn`t always work. Lens modeling is prone to an effect called `over-fitting` where we \n",
    "       underestimate the errors on our lens model parameters. This is especially true when we take the shortcuts in \n",
    "       early phases - fast `NonLinearSearch` settings, simplified lens models, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Therefore, the `width_modifier` in the json config files are our fallback. If the error on a parameter is \n",
    "       suspiciously small, we instead use the value specified in the widths file. These values are chosen based on \n",
    "       our experience as being a good balance broadly sampling parameter space but not being so narrow important \n",
    "       solutions are missed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways a value is specified using the priors/width file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Absolute: In this case, the error assumed on the parameter is the value given in the config file. \n",
    "       For example, if for the width on centre_0 of a `LightProfile`, the width modifier reads \"Absolute\" with a value \n",
    "       0.05. This means if the error on the parameter centre_0 was less than 0.05 in the previous phase, the sigma of \n",
    "       its GaussianPrior in this phase will be 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Relative: In this case, the error assumed on the parameter is the % of the value of the \n",
    "       estimate value given in the config file. For example, if the intensity estimated in the previous phase was 2.0, \n",
    "       and the relative error in the config file reads \"Relative\" with a value 0.5, then the sigma of the GaussianPrior \n",
    "       will be 50% of this value, i.e. sigma = 0.5 * 2.0 = 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use absolute and relative values for different parameters, depending on their properties. For example, using the \n",
    "relative value of a parameter like the `Profile` centre makes no sense. If our lens galaxy is centred at (0.0, 0.0), \n",
    "the relative error will always be tiny and thus poorly defined. Therefore, the default configs in PyAutoLens use \n",
    "absolute errors on the centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are parameters where using an absolute value does not make sense. Intensity is a good example of this. \n",
    "The intensity of an image depends on its unit_label, S/N, galaxy brightness, etc. There is no single absolute value \n",
