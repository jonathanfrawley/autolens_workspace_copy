        " 1) **PyAutoLens** uses Cartesian `Grid2D`'s of $(y,x)$ coordinates to perform ray-tracing.\n",
        " 2) These grids are combined with light and mass profiles to compute images, deflection angles and other quantities.\n",
        " 3) Profiles are grouped together to make galaxies.\n",
        " 4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) form a plane.\n",
        " 5) A `Tracer` can make an image-plane + source-plane strong lens system.\n",
        " 6) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this `Tracer` to convert its units to kiloparsecs.\n",
        " 7) The tracer's mage can be used to simulate strong lens `Imaging` like it was observed with a real telescope.\n",
        " 8) This data can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model strong lens system represents the observed image.\n",
