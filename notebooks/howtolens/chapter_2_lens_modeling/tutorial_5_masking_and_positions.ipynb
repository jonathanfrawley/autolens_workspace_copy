        "If run-time was not a consideration we would always choose a bigger mask, for two reasons:\n",

        " otherwise better constrain the lens model!\n",

        " 2) When the data is fitted with a model image, the fit is performed only within the masked region. For certain lens\n",
        " models it is possible that it may produce extraneous source emission outside of the masked region that is not actually\n",
        " observed in the lens data itself. If this region had not been masked-out, the model would create residuals in these\n",

        "\n",
        "This provides two benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) The model-fit is faster as the non-linear search avoids searching regions of parameter space where the mass-model \n",

        " one another in the source plane simply cannot fit the data accurately).\n",
