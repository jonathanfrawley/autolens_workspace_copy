        "\n",
        " What lens galaxy mass distribution(s) and source galaxy light distribution(s) are responsible for the strong lens\n",

        "To answer questions like this, and therefore use **PyAutoLens** to actually learn about the Universe, we need to\n",

        "without any prior knowledge of what the `correct` model is.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we have to choose the parametrization of our lens model. We don't need to specify the values of its light\n",
        "and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, intensity, einstein_radius, etc.), only the profiles themselves. In this example,\n",
        "we use the following lens model:\n",

        " 1) A Spherical Isothermal Sphere (SIS) mass profile via the `SphIsothermal` profile for the lens galaxy's mass.\n",
        " 2) A Spherical Exponential light profile via the SphExponential` for the source-galaxy's light.\n",

        "\n",

        "Well, with the tools that we learned in chapter 1, we could try the following:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some random set of parameters.\n",
        " 2) Use this lens model to create a `Tracer` and fit the `Imaging` with it, via a `FitImaging` object.\n",
        " 3) Quantify the goodness of fit using the log likelihood.\n",

        "It may sound surprising, but this is actually the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better\n",
        "than random guessing. Instead, we we can track the log likelihoods of all of our previous guesses, and guess more\n",
        "models using the combinations of light and mass profile parameters that gave high log likelihood solutions previously.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that if a set of parameters provided a good fit to the data, another set of parameters with similar values\n",
        "probably will too. Furthermore, if by following this approach we are able to keep guessing models with higher and higher\n",
        "likelihoods, we should eventually 'climb' our way to the model with the highest likelihood overall!\n",

        "This approach to model-fitting is called a `non-linear search` and it is a common algorithm applied by scientists to\n",
