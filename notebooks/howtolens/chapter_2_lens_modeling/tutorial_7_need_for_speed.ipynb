    "Tutorial 7: Need For Speed\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have learnt how to model strong lenses and how to balance complexity and realism to ensure that we\n",
    "infer a good lens model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fitting more complex lens models, the final challenge that we face is keeping the run-time low. One can easily end\n",
    "up in a situation where a model-fit takes days, or longer, to fit just one image. For fitting complex models and high\n",
    "resolution datasets this is somewhat unavoidable. However, it is worth us discussing what drives the long run-times of\n",
    "the lens modeling process and how we might speed it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Searching Non-linear Parameter Space__\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes for the non-linear search to sample parameter space and find the high likelihood models is driven by:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Dimensionality: A more complex parameter space (e.g. more parameters) takes longer to search.\n",
    " - Priors: The broader the priors on each parameter the longer the search.\n",
    " - Settings: Non-linear search settings which sample parameter space more thoroughly lead to longer run-times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use only one search to fit a lens model, we are somewhat restricted in how we can try to achieve faster run\n",
    "times by changing these 3 aspects of the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we introduce 'non-linear search chaining', which fits a lens model using multiple searches that\n",
    "are performed back-to-back. A key motivation for this is that it gives us a lot more flexibility in juggling the\n",
    "dimensionality, priors and settings so as to perform faster and more efficient lens modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Algorithmic Optimization__\n",
    "\n",
    "Every operation **PyAutoLens** performs to fit strong lens data with a model takes time, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Computing the intensity values from a light profile.\n",
    " - Computing deflection angles from a mass profile.\n",
    " - Convolving the image that comes from a tracer with the PSF so compare it to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can therefore in principle make **PyAutoLens** run faster by using faster more efficient algorithms. However, I am\n",
    "confident that for many tasks and operations we have written code that is already very fast!\n",
    "\n",
    "I often get asked, given that **PyAutoLens** is written in Python (a synonomously slow programming language), is it not\n",
    "really slow? **PyAutoLens** uses a library called `numba` to ensure that it runs fast, which recompile Python functions\n",
    "into C functions before **PyAutoLens** runs. This gives us C-like speed, but in Python code. If you`ve got your own\n",
    "code that needs speeding up, I strongly recommend that you look up Numba:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://numba.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **PyAutoLens** is pretty well optimized and there are no 'low hanging fruit' speed ups available by writing\n",
    "thecode in a different language.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Data Quantity__\n",
    "\n",
    "The final factor driving run-speed is the quantity of data that is fitted. For every image-pixel that we fit,\n",
    "we have to compute the light profile intensities, mass profile deflection angles and convolve it with the telescope's\n",
    "PSF. The larger that PSF is, the more convolution operations we have to perform too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercises, we used images with a pixel scale of 0.1\". This value is relatively low resolution: most\n",
    "Hubble Space Telescope images have a pixel scale of 0.05\", which is four times the number of pixels! Some telescopes\n",
    "observe at scales of 0.03\" or, dare I say it, 0.01\". At these resolutions things can run *really* slow down, if we\n",
    "do not think carefully about run speed beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways that we can reduce the number of image-pixels we fit, via masking. If we mask out more of the image,\n",
    "we will fit fewer pixels and **PyAutoLens** will run faster. If you want the best, most perfect lens model possible,\n",
    "aggressive masking and cutting the data in this way is a bad idea, as discussed in tutorial 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Wrap Up__\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial simply wanted to get you thinking about *why* a lens model takes as long to fit as it does."
